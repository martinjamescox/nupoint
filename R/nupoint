#''nupoint': An R package for density estimation from point transects in the
#'presence of non-uniform animal density
#'
#'The R package \pkg{nupoint} provides tools for estimating animal density,
#'using distance sampling methods, from point transect surveys in which the
#'conventional point transect assumption of uniform animal distribution in the
#'vicinity of the point is violated.
#'
#'The key features of the package are as follows:
#'
#'1. By using detection angles as well as distances it allows estimation of
#'both a conventional point transect radial distance detection function and
#'(unlike conventional methods) non-uniform animal density with respect to some
#'observable environmental feature within the searched area (such as distance
#'from road or from shore, or altitude, or depth).
#'
#'2. Key outputs are estimates of density itself, density function parameters,
#'detection function parameters and associated coefficients of variation and
#'confidence intervals.
#'
#'3. The package also provides some tools for plotting and for model diagnosis,
#'AIC statistics for model selection and goodness-of-fit test statistics.
#'
#'4. Finally, a facility to investigate estimator properties by simulation is
#'also provided.
#'
#'The \pkg{nupoint} package handles two types of non-uniform density: (1) when
#'density contours are parallel, these functions are named as \code{nupoint.*},
#'and (2) when density varies with some environmental variable such as seabed
#'depth, these functions are named \code{nupoint.env.*}.
#'
#'The package includes tools for fitting models \code{\link{nupoint.fit}} and
#'\code{\link{nupoint.env.fit}}, model selection, goodness-of-fit testing
#'\code{\link{nupoint.gof}} and \code{\link{nupoint.env.gof}}. Variance
#'estimation is by non-parametric bootstrap \code{\link{nupoint.boot}} and
#'\code{\link{nupoint.env.boot}}.
#'
#'A survey region and sightings simulator \code{\link{nupoint.env.simulator}}
#'is also included.
#'
#'Two datasets: \code{\link{krill}} as an example of parallel density contours,
#'and \code{\link{sightings}} for varying density with an environmental
#'variable, are included and have accompanying vignettes, \code{parallel.pdf}
#'and \code{env.pdf}.
